#Project 2: Brain Tumor Detection using Ultralytics YOLO11


This notebook serves as an initial step for training the YOLO11 model.
## Applications

The application of brain tumor detection using computer vision enables early diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of tumor progression. 
By analyzing medical imaging data like MRI or CT scans, computer vision systems assist in accurately identifying brain tumors, aiding in timely medical intervention and personalized treatment strategies.
